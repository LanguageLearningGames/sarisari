GEOMETRIES: an object geometry represents the shape and structure of a 3D object.
A 3d Object includes these geometry datasets:  
 Vertices
Edges
Faces
Normals: defines the orientation or direction of the faces.
UV Coordinates: 2D coordinates assigned to each vertex of a geometry's face.

MATERIALS: a set of visual properties that determine how an object's surface appears when rendered.
A 3d Object includes these material datasets:
Type
Color
Texture
Transparency
Reflectivity
Normals
Side

MESH: an object that combines a geometry with a material. It represents a 3D object that can be rendered and displayed.
The data contained in a mesh includes:
Geometry: See Geometries
Material: See Materials
Transformations: Meshes contains transformations: => Transforms Tutorial
translation
rotation
scaling
